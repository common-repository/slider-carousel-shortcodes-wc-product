Slider-Carousel-Shortcodes-WC-Product

== Description ==
Include a Slider / Carousel effect in WooCommerce Shortcodes
By adding a shorcode to the original woocmmerce shortcode you can get a Slider-Carousel effect
it can be divided by columns ess: itemswc="3" 

you can split render silde with automatic animation autoplay="true" or autoplay="false"

it is important to keep only 1 column in the original woocmmmerce shortcode

as in the example:
[wccarousel itemswc="3" autoplay="true"]  [products limit="4" columns="1" orderby="popularity"  ] [/wccarousel]

if you want more slides per page the second shortcode will have to be written like this: [wccarousel-b] [/wccarousel-b]

[wccarousel-b itemswc="2" autoplay="true"]  [products limit="4" columns="1" size="full" orderby="popularity" class="" ] [/wccarousel-b]
